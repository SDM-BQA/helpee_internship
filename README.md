## DAY 1

Today, I brushed up on my JavaScript fundamentals and built a simple interactive component that fetches a random image from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) every time a button is clicked. This helped reinforce my understanding of:

- DOM manipulation  
- Handling image loading and error events  

### 📸 Image Generator Component

Below is the sample code I created:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<button id="btn">Generate Image</button>
<div id="loader" class="hidden">Loading...</div>
<div id="info"></div>
<p id="text">Click the button to generate a new image.</p>
<img id="image" style="display: none;" width="400" height="300" />
```

```js
// JavaScript
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  btn.disabled = true;
  console.log("clicked");
  text.classList.add("hidden");
  loader.classList.remove("hidden");

  const imgUrl = `https://picsum.photos/400?random=${Date.now()}`;

  const loadImg = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    img.onload = () => resolve();
    img.onerror = () => reject();
    img.src = imgUrl;
  });

  loadImg
    .then(() => {
      img.style.display = "block";
      info.textContent = "";
    })
    .catch(() => {
      info.textContent = "Something Went Wrong!";
      img.style.display = "none";
    })
    .finally(() => {
      text.classList.remove("hidden");
      loader.classList.add("hidden");
      btn.disabled = false;
      btn.textContent = "Generate Image";
    });
});

```

### ✅ Key Learnings - Day 1

- Brushed up JavaScript basics and DOM manipulation techniques.
- Revised different types of JavaScript functions (regular, arrow functions).
- Implemented image fetching without using `async/await`, handled using Promises.

### ⚠️ Problem Faced - Day 1

- spinner on the button only loading once -> Not Resolved
- on first click it's not generating -> Not Resolved

------

## DAY 2

Today, I worked on building a basic login flow for a web application. I designed two pages:

1. **Login Page** – A simple login form with basic validation.
2. **Home Page** – The landing page users see after a successful login.

The login form redirects to the home page upon submission. This exercise helped me understand the flow between multiple pages in a web app.

### 🔐 Login to Home Page Flow

- Created a login page with email and password inputs.
- Performed simple form validation (e.g., required fields, valid email format).
- On successful login, redirected to the home page using JavaScript.

### 📷 Screenshot (Login Page UI)

![Login Page](./day%202/src/login.png)

### 📷 Screenshot (Home Page UI)

![Home Page](./day%202/src/home.png)

### ✅ Key Learnings

- Brushed up on designing responsive pages using HTML and CSS.
- Improved understanding of CSS styling for layout and UI.
- Implemented basic client-side form validation using JavaScript.
- Managed redirection from login to home page using simple logic.

### ⚠️ Problem Faced - Day 2

- css alignment
  
------

## DAY 3

Today, I made improvements to the home page of the application. I focused on personalizing the user experience by fetching and displaying the user's name stored in `localStorage`.

In addition, I spent time watching JavaScript tutorials to strengthen my understanding of core concepts.

### 🔧 Updates Made

- Retrieved and displayed the logged-in user's name using `localStorage`.
- Made minor content or layout improvements on the home page.
- Tested the login → home flow to ensure data persistence worked smoothly.

### 🖼️ Screenshot

![Home Page Update](./day%202/src/updated_home.png)

### ✅ Key Learnings -Day 3

- How to store and retrieve data using `localStorage`.
- Enhanced understanding of how front-end data persists across pages.
- Reinforced JavaScript fundamentals through tutorial videos.

> 📌 No major issues faced during implementation today.

------

## DAY 4

Today, I built a simple **To-Do App** and integrated it with the login component I created on Day 2. The username is fetched from `localStorage` and displayed on the to-do screen for a personalized experience.

The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and (intended) edit them — though I faced issues with the edit functionality.

### 📝 Features Implemented

- User login reused from Day 2 to personalize the app.
- Add new to-do tasks with input validation.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- Display the logged-in user's name from `localStorage`.

### ⚠️ Problem Faced - day 4

- Faced challenges with **editing existing tasks** — changes were either not reflected or overwritten incorrectly.
- Need to revisit DOM element tracking and state update logic for better control over task edits.

### 🖼️ Screenshots

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 4

- Reusing login components and data across pages.
- Better grasp of working with dynamic lists in JavaScript.
- Need more clarity on DOM updates for editable elements.

------

## DAY 5

Today, I attended a 30-minute introductory session on **TypeScript**. The class covered the basics such as:

- `interface`
- `type`
- Static typing fundamentals

After the session, I explored TypeScript further by creating a small number guessing game. This helped me understand how functions and type annotations work in TypeScript.

### 🎮 Small Guessing Game in TypeScript

```ts
const btn = document.getElementById("btn") as HTMLInputElement;
const numInput = document.getElementById("num") as HTMLInputElement;
const result = document.getElementById("result") as HTMLInputElement;

let randomNum: number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

function checkNumber(userNum: number, actualNum: number): void {
  if (userNum > actualNum) {
    result.textContent = "Guess low number";
  } else if (userNum < actualNum) {
    result.textContent = "Guess High number";
  } else {
    result.textContent = "You Guessed it right";
  }
}

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (numInput.value) {
    const userGuess = parseInt(numInput.value);
    if (!isNaN(userGuess)) {
      checkNumber(userGuess, randomNum);
    } else {
      result.textContent = "Please enter a valid number.";
    }
    numInput.value = "";
  }
});

```

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 5

- Understood basic TypeScript syntax and types.

- Learned how to define and use number types in functions.

- Practiced writing simple logic with typed parameters.

- Reinforced understanding of control flow using if/else.

## DAY 7

Today, I focused on understanding **Redux**, which initially felt a bit confusing. I watched two videos to understand the basic flow of how Redux works with React, and things started to make more sense by the end of the day.

Later, our sir gave us a **Redux demo**, and with its help, I was able to create a simple component that shows a counter and updates it using two buttons (increment and decrement). I followed the official Redux documentation to guide my implementation.

------

```tsx
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import type { RootState } from "../app/store";
import {
  decrementounter,
  incrementCounter,
} from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

const Counter = () => {
  const state = useSelector((root: RootState) => root.counter);
  const { counter } = state;
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const increment = () => {
    dispatch(incrementCounter());
  };
  const decrement = () => {
    dispatch(decrementounter());
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Counter: {counter}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## DAY 8

Today, I converted the **Login Page (from Day 2)** into a **React + TypeScript** project and styled it using **Tailwind CSS**. This was my first hands-on project using Tailwind, and although I faced some initial difficulty understanding the utility classes, the final result turned out well.

Now, I feel confident building websites using Tailwind CSS.

------

### 🔧 What I Did

- Rebuilt the login component in a React TypeScript project.
- Used **Tailwind CSS** for styling instead of traditional CSS.
- Improved the UI appearance with consistent spacing, colors, and layout.
- Faced some initial challenges with layout alignment and spacing in Tailwind.
- Still need to test and improve the **responsiveness** of the layout.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings day 8

- Improved understanding of **React + TypeScript** project structure.
- Practiced using **Tailwind utility classes** for layout, spacing, typography, and buttons.
- Gained confidence in converting vanilla HTML/CSS to modern tech stacks.
- Realized the importance of **responsive design**, planning to explore media queries and Tailwind breakpoints.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 8

- Faced confusion in the beginning with **Tailwind class combinations** for padding, margin, and centering elements.
- Struggled with **alignment issues**, especially with form layout and button placement.
- Initially forgot to configure **Tailwind correctly** with React + TypeScript (postcss setup).
- Need more clarity on handling **responsive design** using Tailwind’s `sm`, `md`, `lg` breakpoints.

------

## Day 9

Today, I learned how to use **Redux** with **Redux Thunk** and implemented it in the login flow of my project. I used Redux to store the email and password entered on the login page and displayed the user's name on the home page. Additionally, I made an API request using **Redux Thunk** to fetch and display a list of users.

------

- 🔧 What I Did

- Integrated **Redux** into the login page to manage user credentials (email and password).
- Passed the stored user data to the **Home Page** using Redux state.
- Used **Redux Thunk** to make an asynchronous API call to fetch user names.
- Displayed the fetched user list on the home page.
- Practiced combining Redux with components and handling state updates smoothly.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 9

- Deepened understanding of Redux state management in a React + TypeScript setup.
- Learned how to write **actions**, **reducers**, and configure **Redux store**.
- Gained practical experience with **Redux Thunk** for asynchronous actions (API calls).
- Improved ability to share global state (e.g., user info) across components.
- Understood how to debug and monitor Redux actions and state changes effectively.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 9

- Initial confusion about where to place the async logic for API calls in Redux.
- Faced issues with properly dispatching the thunk action from the component.
- Minor trouble with displaying fetched data due to incorrect state structure.

------

### 🧱 Redux Store Configuration

```ts
// store.ts
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import auth_reducer from "../features/login/authSlice";
import user_reducer from "../features/users/userInfoSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: auth_reducer,
    user: user_reducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
```

- AuthSlice

```ts
// authSlice.ts
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState: {
    email: "",
    password: "",
  },
  reducers: {
    logIn: (
      state,
      action: PayloadAction<{ email: string; password: string }>
    ) => {
      state.email = action.payload.email;
      state.password = action.payload.password;
    },
    logOut: (state) => {
      state.email = "";
      state.password = "";
    },
  },
});

export const { logIn, logOut } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
```

- Users Slice
  
```ts
// userInfoSlice.ts
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import axios from "axios";

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

interface UserState {
  data: User[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

const initialState: UserState = {
  data: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
};

export const fetchUsers = createAsyncThunk("user/fetchUsers", async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
  return response.data;
});

const userInfoSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState,
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchUsers.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true;
        state.error = null;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUsers.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.data = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUsers.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.error = action.error.message || "Something went wrong";
      });
  },
});

export default userInfoSlice.reducer;

```

## DAY 12

Today, I created a new **ToDo App** using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a new state management library called **Zustand**. It was my first time exploring Zustand, and I found it lightweight and easy to integrate compared to Redux.

------

### 🔧 What I Did - day 12

- ✅ Built a fully functional **ToDo App**.
- ✅ Used **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and clean UI.
- ✅ Integrated **Zustand** for managing global state (tasks list, input, updates).
- ✅ Added functionality to **add**, **delete**, and **toggle** task status.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 12

- Understood the basics of **Zustand** store creation and usage.
- Learned to manage application state globally without boilerplate code.
- Improved knowledge of **Tailwind utility classes** for quick UI styling.
- Built a clear separation between state logic and UI components.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced

- Initially confused about how Zustand works compared to Redux or useContext.
- Faced issues updating and persisting tasks correctly on multiple re-renders.
- Styling responsiveness using Tailwind took a few extra iterations.

------

### 🖼️ Screenshot Todo App

### TodoStore

```ts
import { create } from "zustand";

interface Tasks {
  id: string,
  name:string,
  description:string,
  tag:string,
  priority:{
    name:string,
    value:string,
    priorityNum:number
  },
  time:string,
  status:string
}

const todoStore = (set, get) => ({
  todos: JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todos")) || [],

  filterType: "all",
  addTask: (task:Tasks) => {
    const newTask = {
      ...task,
      status: "active",
      time: new Date().toLocaleString(),
    };

    const updatedTodos = [...get().todos, newTask];

    set({ todos: updatedTodos });

    localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(updatedTodos));
  },

  taskStatus: (id:string) => {
    const todos = get().todos;
    const updatedTodos = todos.map((todo:Tasks) => {
      if (todo.id === id && todo.status === "active") {
        return {
          ...todo,
          status: "completed",
        };
      } else if (todo.id === id && todo.status === "completed") {
        return {
          ...todo,
          status: "active",
        };
      } else {
        return todo;
      }
    });
    set((state) => ({
      todos: updatedTodos,
    }));
    localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(updatedTodos));
  },

  deleteTask: (id:string) => {
    const todos = get().todos;
    const updatedTodos = todos.filter((todo:Tasks) => todo.id !== id);

    set((state) => ({
      todos: updatedTodos,
    }));
    localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(updatedTodos));
  },
  setFilterType: (type:string) => {
    set({ filterType: type });
  },
});

const useTodoStore = create(todoStore);

export default useTodoStore;

```

### 📦 Installed Dependencies - day 12

```bash
npm install zustand
```

------

## DAY 13

Today, I **converted the UI** of my existing **ToDo App** (from Day 12) from **Tailwind CSS** to **Ant Design**. Alongside the design overhaul, I also **refactored the progress bar logic** to work dynamically based on selected task tags.

------

### 🔧 What I Did - day 13

- ✅ Replaced all **Tailwind components** with clean, ready-made **Ant Design components**.
- ✅ Updated forms, buttons, layout, and task cards using Ant Design.
- ✅ Refined the **progress bar** to reflect completion status **based on selected tag only** instead of all tasks.
- ✅ Ensured consistent design and responsiveness with Ant Design grid system.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 13

- Gained hands-on experience with **Ant Design components** like:
  - `Form`, `Input`, `Select`, `Button`, `Card`, `Progress`, `Tag`, `Row`, `Col`.
- Learned to **conditionally render** progress based on selected filter/tag.
- Understood Ant Design's **grid layout system** and styling customization.
- Realized how Ant Design accelerates UI development with consistency.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 13

- Faced some difficulty replacing Tailwind layout with Ant Design’s grid system.
- Needed extra logic to dynamically calculate **tag-specific progress**.
- Encountered styling overrides while mixing custom CSS with Ant Design classes.

------

### 🖼️ Screenshot Todo App using Ant Design

### 📦 Installed Dependencies - day 13

```bash
npm install antd
```

------

## DAY 14

Today, I built a **custom calendar component** using **React** and **Ant Design**. I focused on manually rendering dates, handling month/year navigation, and applying **custom styles for weekends (Saturday and Sunday)**. This component was styled using both Ant Design and custom CSS.

------

### 🔧 What I Did - day 14

- ✅ Created a custom calendar layout using **Ant Design's** `Flex`, `Button`, and other components.
- ✅ Highlighted the current date with a special color.
- ✅ Applied custom text colors for:
  - **Sunday** → Red
  - **Saturday** → Blue
- ✅ Implemented navigation:
  - Switch months and years using arrow buttons.
  - Jump to **Today** with a dedicated button.
- ✅ Handled blank cells for start-of-month alignment.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings -day 14

- Improved skills using **Ant Design’s Flex layout** for building structured UIs.
- Learned to calculate:
  - First day of the month
  - Number of days in a month
  - Day alignment in a calendar grid
- Applied **conditional styling** based on `weekDay` and `isToday`.
- Understood the importance of date manipulation using native **JavaScript Date API**.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 14

- Handling the offset for the first day (start alignment) required careful date logic.
- Customizing weekend styles without affecting weekday layout.
- Managing responsive design within fixed column widths (14.28%).

------

### 📷 Screenshot Calender

![Calendar Component](./day%2014/src/assets/calender.png)

------

## DAY 15

Today, I designed a **dashboard layout** using **React with TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. Though the dashboard is currently non-functional, I populated it with **dummy data** to simulate real UI behavior. I also explored **Nivo Charts** for rendering beautiful, customizable charts.

------

### 🔧 What I Did - day 15

- ✅ Created a multi-panel **dashboard UI** with `LeftPanel` and `RightPanel` layout.
- ✅ Used **Tailwind CSS** to style sections, components, and layout.
- ✅ Created reusable components like:
  - `Navbar`
  - `Profile`
  - `ProfileStats`
  - `ProfileTracker`
- ✅ Implemented **Nivo Charts** to visualize task tracking using dummy data.
- ✅ Applied **glassmorphism effect**, shadows, and soft gradients to the layout.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 15

- Understood how to:
  - Align components using Tailwind’s `flex`, `gap`, `h-dvh`, and `w-*` utilities.
  - Create **glass-effect UI** using semi-transparent backgrounds and blur.
  - Use **Nivo Charts** for clean, responsive data visualization.
- Learned to **overlap divs** effectively using positioning, `z-index`, and Tailwind's layout utilities.
- Got hands-on practice with **component composition** in React.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 15

- Initial layout alignment was tricky—especially making it responsive.
- Overlapping divs correctly with layered design needed careful styling.
- Customizing Nivo Chart appearance with gradients and legends required extra effort.

------

### 🖼️ Dashboard Screenshot - day 15

### 📦 Installed Dependencies - day 15

```bash
npm install @nivo/core @nivo/bar
```

------

## DAY 16

Today, I upgraded the **custom calendar component** (from Day 14) by adding the ability to **add and view events or notes** on individual dates. I also implemented **right-click (context menu)** and **left-click handling** without relying on any pre-built context menu libraries.

------

### 🔧 What I Did - day 16

- ✅ Added feature to **add events and notes** to specific calendar dates.
- ✅ If an event or note exists for a day, a small **icon appears** on the respective date cell.
- ✅ Implemented **left-click vs. right-click** handling using native `mousedown` logic.
  - **Left-click** → Shows event/note list for that day.
  - **Right-click** → Opens context menu to add event or note.
- ✅ Tracked and filtered events/notes using the date string like `23 June, 2025`.
- ✅ Stored notes and events separately but displayed based on matching `dayId`.
- ✅ Used a custom **`useEffect` hook** to track clicks and update the UI accordingly.

------

### ✅ Key Learnings - day 16

- Learned how to:
  - Detect **mouse click types** using `e.button === 0` (left) and `e.button === 2` (right).
  - Dynamically **position a context menu** using `clientX` and `clientY`.
  - Efficiently **filter and map notes/events** based on the selected day.
- Realized the importance of separating logic:
  - Currently, the **entire component is inside one file**, making it hard to maintain.
  - Next step: break it into modular subcomponents.

------

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 16

- Mapping the events to the correct calendar day took several attempts to format and compare dates consistently.
- Having the entire calendar, event logic, and context menu in a single file made the code lengthy and difficult to debug.
- Ensuring correct UI updates for both left and right clicks needed multiple state dependencies in the `useEffect`.

------

### 🧠 Code Snippet: Mouse Click Logic

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseDown = (e) => {
    if (e.button === 0 && e.target.id) {
      setVisibleSideBar(true);
      const day = `${e.target.id} ${currentMonth[0].name}, ${currentYear}`;
      setFilterEventTracker(() =>
        eventTracker.filter((eventName) => eventName.dayId === day)
      );
      setFilterNoteTracker(() =>
        noteTracker.filter((noteName) => noteName.dayId === day)
      );
      if (visibleContextMenu) setVisibleContextMenu(false);
    } else if (e.button === 2 && e.target.id) {
      setXPosition(e.clientX);
      setYPosition(e.clientY);
      setDayId(e.target.id);
      if (visibleSideBar) setVisibleSideBar(false);
      setVisibleContextMenu(true);
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener("mousedown", handleMouseDown);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("mousedown", handleMouseDown);
  };
}, [eventTracker, noteTracker, visibleContextMenu, currentMonth, currentYear]);
```

## DAY 17

Today, I focused on exploring **class-based components** in React and their lifecycle methods. I also revisited and explored key React concepts like `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useParams`, `useRef`, and **Error Boundaries**.

------

### ✅ What I Did - day 17

- Created a **Counter component** using class-based components.
- Used lifecycle methods: `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
- Fetched dummy data inside class component lifecycle.
- Created a **Login and User Info page** using `useParams` to pass and extract data via URL.
- Revisited `useEffect` for component lifecycle in functional components.
- Learnt about `useMemo` and its use in memoizing computations.
- Learnt about `useMemo` and its use in referring element.
- Learnt and implemented **Error Boundaries** in React.

------

### 🧠 Key Learnings - day 17

- **Class-based lifecycle methods**:  
  - `componentDidMount` – API calls or setup logic.  
  - `componentDidUpdate` – Respond to prop/state changes.  
  - `componentWillUnmount` – Cleanup tasks.

- **React Router – `useParams`** to extract values from the URL dynamically.

- **`useEffect` vs class methods**: Functional component lifecycle replacement.

- **`useMemo`** – Used to memoize expensive calculations to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

- **`useRef`** – Helps to hold mutable values and access DOM nodes directly.

- **Error Boundary** – A fallback mechanism in class-based components to catch rendering errors.

------

### 🧪 Sample Code Snippets - day 17

#### 🔢 Counter Using Class

```tsx
class CounterUsingClass extends Component<MyComponentsProps, MyComponentsState> {
  ...
  render(): ReactNode {
    return (
      <div>
        <FaPlus onClick={this.handleIncrement} />
        Count is: {this.state.count}
        <FaMinus onClick={this.handleDecrement} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

------

#### 📄 Lifecycle Fetch Example

```ts
componentDidMount(): void {
  this.fetchUser(); // Fetch user on initial render
}
componentDidUpdate(prevProps: Props): void {
  if (prevProps.userId !== this.props.userId) this.fetchUser();
}
```

------

#### 🌐 Login with useParams

```tsx
<Link to={`/login/${userName}/${userEmail}`}>
  Login
</Link>

const { userName, userEmail } = useParams();
```

#### 🚨 Error Boundary

```tsx
static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {
  return { hasError: true };
}
```

### ⚠️ Problems Faced - day 17

Understanding when exactly each lifecycle method triggers.

Mapping the usage of useEffect to class methods was tricky at first.

Understanding how to pass props to class-based components.

Figuring out how Error Boundary works in contrast to try/catch blocks.

------

## DAY 18

Today I started learning **Next.js** and explored its core concepts related to the App Router and routing system. I also created a mini project that fetches data from three different public APIs using server components.

------

### 🔍 Topics Covered - day 18

#### 📦 Server Component

Server components in Next.js run exclusively on the server and do not send any JavaScript to the browser. They are ideal for data-fetching, heavy logic, and improving performance since they reduce bundle size.

#### 🧠 Client Component

Client components are interactive React components rendered in the browser. To make a component a client component, the `"use client"` directive must be added at the top. These are used when the component requires state, effects, or event handling.

#### 🛤️ App-based Routing

Next.js uses **file-based routing**. Each file inside the `app/` directory automatically becomes a route. For example, `app/about/page.tsx` corresponds to `/about`.

#### 🔁 Dynamic Routes

Dynamic segments can be defined using square brackets, like `app/user/[id]/page.tsx`. This allows capturing parameters directly from the URL.

#### 📁 Route Groups

Route groups (`(group-name)`) help organize files in the `app/` folder without affecting the URL structure. They are useful for separating layouts or middleware logic cleanly.

#### 🧩 Layout

Layouts in Next.js define shared UI across pages. The `layout.tsx` file can wrap routes to provide consistent elements like headers or footers.

#### 🧭 Nested Layouts

Nested layouts allow different sections of a site to have unique layouts. A layout file placed inside a folder wraps only that route and its children, creating hierarchy and reuse.

#### 🔗 Navigation

Next.js provides `Link` from `next/link` and the `useRouter` hook for navigating between routes programmatically or declaratively.

#### 📍 usePathname

`usePathname` is a hook from `next/navigation` used to retrieve the current URL path. It's useful for conditional rendering or active link states based on the route.

#### 🔁 Redirect using useRouter

With `useRouter`, you can programmatically redirect users using `router.push()` or `router.replace()`, ideal for login flows or navigation after form submission.

#### 🔨 Route Handlers

Route handlers in `app/api/route.ts` are used to define API endpoints. These replace the older `pages/api` and follow RESTful conventions like `GET`, `POST`, etc.

#### 📦 Data Fetching (Client & Server)

- **Client-side**: Done inside client components using `useEffect` or SWR.
- **Server-side**: Done directly in server components or via `getServerSideProps` in the Pages Router (not used in App Router).
  
#### ⚙️ Server Actions

Server Actions allow you to define async functions that run only on the server. These are still experimental but provide a clean way to perform data mutations without API routes.

### 🔨 Mini Project: Predicting Age, Gender, and Country by Name

I created a small project in Next.js that fetches predictions from 3 public APIs (`agify.io`, `genderize.io`, `nationalize.io`) using server-side rendering.

```ts
const getPredictedAge = async (name: string) => {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.agify.io/?name=${name}`);
  return res.json();
};

const getPredictedGender = async (name: string) => {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.genderize.io/?name=${name}`);
  return res.json();
};

const getPredictedCountry = async (name: string) => {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.nationalize.io/?name=${name}`);
  return res.json();
};

export default async function Prediction({ params }: { params: { name: string } }) {
  const ageData = getPredictedAge(params.name);
  const genderData = getPredictedGender(params.name);
  const countryData = getPredictedCountry(params.name);

  const [age, gender, country] = await Promise.all([
    ageData,
    genderData,
    countryData,
  ]);

  // Render logic here
}
```

### ⚠️ Problem Faced - day 18

- Initially, I was confused between server and client components and when to use each. I also faced issues while fetching data in a server component because of misunderstanding the async behavior in Next.js.

## DAY 19

### 🚀 GraphQL & Apollo Exploration

Today, I explored **GraphQL** concepts and implemented a simple **Apollo Server** using Express. I also fetched real data from the **SpaceX GraphQL API** to understand how GraphQL queries work in real-world APIs.

------

### 📘 Main Concepts in GraphQL & Apollo

#### **1. GraphQL Basics**

- **Query**: To fetch data from the server.
- **Mutation**: To add, update, or delete data on the server.
- **Subscription**: For real-time updates (not covered today, but noted for future).

#### **2. Apollo Server & Client**

- **Apollo Server**: A powerful tool to define schema and resolvers using GraphQL and expose them via an HTTP endpoint.
- **Apollo Client**: A React-friendly GraphQL client that makes querying and caching easier.

#### **3. GraphQL Schema**

- **Types**: Used to define the structure of data (e.g., `Book` type).
- **Queries**: Used to get the list or individual data (like `books`, `book`).
- **Mutations**: Used to change the data (like `addBook`).
- **Resolvers**: Functions that handle the actual logic for fetching and returning data.

#### **4. Apollo Server Setup**

- `typeDefs`: Defines GraphQL types, queries, and mutations using the `gql` template literal.
- `resolvers`: Contains the functions to resolve the defined queries/mutations.
- **Express Integration**: Apollo Server is mounted on an Express server.

#### **5. Apollo Client Setup**

- `ApolloProvider`: Wraps the app to provide context.
- `useQuery`, `useMutation`: Hooks for performing GraphQL operations from the frontend.

#### **6. TypeScript Integration**

- Type safety for both the server and client.
- Interfaces help define the data shape clearly.

#### **7. Benefits of GraphQL**

- Request only the required data.
- Avoid over-fetching and under-fetching.
- Single endpoint for all operations.

### 🧪 Project: Apollo Server for Book Store

I created a simple GraphQL server using **Apollo Server** and **Express**. Below is the code snippet for setting up types, resolvers, and the server:

```ts
import { ApolloServer, gql } from "apollo-server-express";
import express from "express";

const books = [
  {
    bookName: "The Great Gatsby",
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    publishedYear: 1925,
    price: 10.99,
  },
  {
    bookName: "1984",
    author: "George Orwell",
    publishedYear: 1949,
    price: 8.99,
  },
  {
    bookName: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    author: "Harper Lee",
    publishedYear: 1960,
    price: 12.99,
  },
];

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Book {
    bookName: String
    author: String
    publishedYear: Int
    price: Float
  }

  type Query {
    books: [Book]
    book(bookName: String!): Book
  }

  type Mutation {
    addBook(
      bookName: String!
      author: String!
      publishedYear: Int!
      price: Float!
    ): Book
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
    book: (_: any, { bookName }: { bookName: String }) =>
      books.find((book) => book.bookName === bookName),
  },
  Mutation: {
    addBook: (
      _: any,
      { bookName, author, publishedYear, price }: { bookName: string; author: string; publishedYear: number; price: number }
    ) => {
      const newBook = { bookName, author, publishedYear, price };
      books.push(newBook);
      return newBook;
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
const app = express();

const startServer = async () => {
  await server.start();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:4000/graphql`);
  });
};

startServer();
```

### 🧠 What I Learned - day 19

- The difference between REST and GraphQL.

- How resolvers map incoming queries to logic.

- The flexibility of fetching only required fields in GraphQL.

- Apollo Server integration with Express.

- How to perform simple mutations to add data.

- The benefit of using GraphQL in modern APIs.
